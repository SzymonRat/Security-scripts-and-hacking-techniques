API endpoint exploitation:

XXE injection (payload carried by POST)

Put through SQLmap  
http://<victim_ip>/*
use different HTTP methods
pass data in a different forms (json/standard etc)
try to get an access to the API management panel (/docs or /?wsdl or /wadl) go the the “PUT edit” method -> type your ID -> in the field add “<is_superuser>”:true -> execute, if vulnerable now you escalated your privileges, now re-login to get a new admin token
type confusion
original
http://<victim_ip>/api/user/<id>

change into
http://<victim_ip>/api/user/1.0

#by making a decimal value you will cause that application will error out an give you some data e.g password of the user
