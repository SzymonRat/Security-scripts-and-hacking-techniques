interesting file: /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf

From the web browser 

access is granted via brute-forcing or finding credentials somewhere around
after getting an access as the Administrator, Ican get a command execution by:
going to the Administration-> Scripts>creating a script containing your malicious command that will be executed on the target agent

 going to the Configuration->hosts->items->choose one of them->clone it -> type

system.run[bash -c ‘nohup <cmd> &’]

from the terminal 

echo “system.run[bash –c ‘nohup <cmd> &’ ]” | nc <victim_ip> <zabbix_port>

#the & character at the end and ‘nohup’ at the beginning  are needed so our shell will not be killed
